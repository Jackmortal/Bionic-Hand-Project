# Bionic Hand Firmware

This README contains the firmware for MK0 of my Bionic Hand Project. Below are brief descriptions of each file:

- **ServoTest.py** - Code to test each finger on the hand. This code allows you to test each fingers range of motion from 0 to any degree your servo is limited to.

# Start now:
- **Hand_Fist.py** - 
- **Hand_Open.py** - 

#Next:
- **Hand_MiddleFinger** -
- **Hand_Point.py** - 
- **Hand_Peace.py** -

#Then:
- 'Add a way to trigger gestures (keyboard or button)'
- 'Add object detection (attach camera module to palm of hand)'

#Long term goal:
- 'Add machine learning capabilities'
